# Summary

I am currently pursuing an MPhil in Engineering at Swansea University, where I am engaged in advanced studies within the field of computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction. 
I hold a prestigious Master's degree in Physics with first-class honours from Cardiff University, which has equipped me with a strong foundation in scientific principles and critical thinking. 
Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a profound fascination for data science and data analysis, recognising their immense potential to drive innovation and inform decision-making.

# Academic Experience
### Swansea University - Post Graduate Research (September 2019 - Present) 
- Engaged in a research project initially intended as an EngD in Engineering, subsequently completed as an MPhil due to funding constraints. However, a significant proportion of the taught modules for the EngD were completed.
- Developed an efficient and open-source tool using MATLAB, Python, and OpenFOAM to predict structural response under industrial flow conditions.
- Undertook a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computational fluid dynamics, structural dynamics, design, data analysis, and data visualisation.
	
### Cardiff University - Undergraduate Research (October 2018 - May 2019)
- Conducted Python programming to investigate various types of biological protein interaction networks.
- Employed search algorithms such as breadth-first and depth-first searches, along with scientific analysis and visualisation packages in Python.
- Utilised findings to identify significant protein interactions for drug-targeting purposes.

### Cardiff University - Undergraduate Research (October 2017 - May 2018)
- Implemented Python programming to simulate gas particles within a confined space and analyse gas properties.
- Applied Python packages like NumPy and SciPy, and employed object-oriented programming.
